Dear Cem,
we would like to send you our little challenge for the technical assessment. Its a data exploration and presentation challenge; the idea is that you take a look and work on the challenge and then present the results to parts of the team, followed by some questions and also getting to know everyone. This could be online or in our lovely office, however you prefer!

General Notes:
We are sending the task and the data below - it should only take a few hours to completeYou can use any tools you like - preferably something where we can see your coding skills though :-) You don't have to create a formal presentation, your code would be the most interesting thing for us to see.Depending on when you have time to work on it, we would then set up a meeting where you can present your findings (~20 minutes) to parts of our team and we can have some time for questions and getting to know you afterwards.The Challenge1. Exploration
Take a look at the two datasets and explore the data. The main dataset comes from here.
The column “LOR” means “Lebensweltlich orientierte Räume” and they are the basis for many planning decisions in Berlin. The first two numbers represent the district, so you can “translate” the LOR using the dataset with the district numbers and this systematic.
2. Analysis
Imagine you are an administration official and need to monitor bike thefts in Berlin:
What could a useful dashboard look like?Describe the dashboard roughly and show some example graphs!What kind of additional data could be useful to have?3. Present your findings
Explain the data (as far as you understood)What are the first steps you take when getting a dataset like this?Show and explain some interesting insights and how the dashboard could look like4. Additional Questions
Why did you choose the query language you did?Imagine this data is updated daily: how could a pipeline look like? Explain the tools and setup.Let us know if you have any questions!

Have a nice rest of the day,
Philipp
